# Course FAQ

### Is lecture/tutorial participation mandatory?

No. We do not impose any lecture/tutorial participation rules. In principle, you can complete the course without lecture/tutorial participation. It is however important that you should join lectures and tutorials where we can have face-to-face discussions. At the moment, we do not plan to record lectures and tutorials. Note that you may be required to be in person to explain your assignments.

### Is assignment/project independent work so that I dont have to team up with other students?

Assignment/project work is independent at the moment. Thus you can complete the course without teamwork as long as you obtain enough marks from your assignments. Note that you may be required to be in person to explain your assignments.

### Can I complete the course successful without lecture/tutorial participation?

No one knows except you. The course requires both theoretical and engineering understandings of big data platforms but also requires a lot of effort on design, implementation and testing of some key concepts in big data platforms. Lectures/tutorials guide your way but at the end you need to touch a lot of hands-on of real world systems. Having good exchanges and discussions with others can help you to speed up your study.

### I am a student from the business school, do I need to spend a lot of time to design and implement stuffs in big data platforms?

Unfortunately, to understand big data platforms, we need to work on design, development, testing and operation aspects. While, business school students can focus more on utilizing big data platforms for running analytics, we require all students to understand big data platforms from a holistic view.

### Can I learn the course without knowning cloud computing?
Cloud computing is an important background as our big data platforms rely on cloud technologies (not necessarily requires specific cloud providers). If you dont know cloud computing, you should learn cloud computing at the same time, e.g. from Mobile & Cloud Computing course.

### Can I use my own dataset (e.g. from my company) for exercises/assignments?

Yes you can but you need to discuss with the lecturer first.
